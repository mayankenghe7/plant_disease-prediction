# plant_disease-prediction
 Designing a CNN model to predict diseases in plants This project employs deep learning techniques to predict and classify crop diseases. The objectives include detecting unhealthy plant leaf regions, analyzing them, and accurately classifying diseases using various features. To enhance accuracy, the project emphasizes training the algorithm on large datasets. The goal is to provide a valuable tool for early disease detection in crops, enabling improved agricultural practices and higher crop yields.
